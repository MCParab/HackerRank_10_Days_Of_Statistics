PROBLEM :
  There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

  1. Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls. 
  2. Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
  3. Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. 

  One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

SOLUTION :

  P(Urn X giving red ball R)=4/7
  P(Urn Y giving red ball R)=5/9
  P(Urn Z giving red ball R)=1/2

  P(Urn X giving black ball B)=3/7
  P(Urn Y giving black ball B)=4/9
  P(Urn Z giving black ball B)=1/2

  P(2 R, 1 B) = P(RRB) + P(RBR) + P(BRR)
              =(4/7)(5/9)(1/2) + (4/7)(4/9)(1/2) + (3/7)(5/9)(1/2)
              =17/42
