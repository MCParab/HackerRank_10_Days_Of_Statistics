PROBLEM :
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

SOLUTION :

  Sample Space for required problem (S) :
     s=(1,5), (5,1), (2,4), (4,2)

  Hence,
        P(sum==6 && Values rolled be different)=4/36

  ANSWER : 1/9
